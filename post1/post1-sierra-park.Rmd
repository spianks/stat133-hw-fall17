A loss function, or called cost function, is used i nmachine learning to optimize problems with linear predictors.


In class, we talked abour lossfunctions for regression that depends on the residual:
$$
r = y - \hat{y}
$$

There are three types of loss functions:

#1 Absolute Loss 
$$
L(\theta, y)  = |y - \theta|
$$

asdf


#2 Squared Loss
$$
L(\theta, y) = (y - \theta)^2
$$

asfd

#3 Huber Loss


$$
\Large L_\alpha\left( \theta, y \right) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{2}\left( y - \theta \right)^2 & \left| y - \theta \right| < \alpha \\ \alpha \left(\left| y - \theta \right| - \frac{\alpha}{2} \right) & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} 
$$
